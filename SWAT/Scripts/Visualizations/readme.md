Some of these codes are adapted from Sundar Niroula's work in Niroula et al., 2023 (see references below). I have created the following visualization scripts: SWAT_visualizations_reaches.R, SWAT_visualizations_reaches_consolidated.R, SWAT_visualizations_subbasin_scenario_comparisons.R, SWAT_visualizations_subbasinscale.R.

Feel free to reach me at egolub2@illinois.edu for any clarifications on how to used these scripts to produce desired visualizations.
